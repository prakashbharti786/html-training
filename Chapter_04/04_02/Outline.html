<p>Spotlight favorite</p>
<p>One of my favorite albums has always been Lorem Ipsum. It's such a transitional album, as it bridges the gap between sweeping, album-based releases to the present day scene of downloaded songs that aren't consumed in the framework of a larger piece. Rolling Stone once called it the &quot;last great album,&quot; and they might have been right!</p>
